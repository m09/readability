Readability demo
================

This demo uses the scala server provided in this repository.

It aims at providing a usable interface to investigate the results of
the Wikipedia simple experiments. Once you've launched the server, you
can use index.html directly.

If you didn't launch the server on `localhost:9000`, you have to
update readability.js and then issue a `grunt` command to rebuild the
javascript file.
